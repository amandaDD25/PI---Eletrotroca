# PI Eletro

## Summary

The Eletro-Troca Project was developed to support the Coopemape Catadores Maria da Penha initiative, which focuses on recycling electronic waste. 
The main goal is to create a digital system (website or app) to organize donations, register donors and collectors, and improve transparency. 

Using modern technologies and agile methods, the project helps the Cooperative control materials more efficiently and generate reports automatically. 
The system promotes sustainability, social inclusion, and technological innovation, showing how technology can transform communities.
